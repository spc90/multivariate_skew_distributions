# multivariate_skew_distributions
Python implementations for multivariate skew distributions

The multivariate t distribution implementation is based on the code of Gregory Gunderson: https://github.com/gwgundersen/multivariate-t-distribution. 
While the code in this repo was being developed, a version of Gunderson's code was merged into SciPy (Oct. 2020: https://github.com/scipy/scipy/pull/12582). 
More details of that version of the code can be found on Gunderson's blog: http://gregorygundersen.com/blog/2020/01/20/multivariate-t/.
The version in this repo contains some small improvements (e.g. computing also the gradient of the pdf) and changes to function signatures which seemed more in line with existing SciPy code.

The skew versions of the multivariate t and normal distributions have an implementation that matches closely the scipy.stats style/signatures. Additionaly, implementations for computing the gradient of the pdf have been added (which is something not implemented for any distribution in scipy.stats).

The iPython notebook presents the mathematical descriptions and tests to validate the implementations.
